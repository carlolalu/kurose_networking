# various networking projects

This repo should gather various projects and exercises related to networking (and eventually the costruction of a small cpp-GUI). I follow the book of Kurose, "Computer Networking - a top down approach", the 8th edition

Idea regarding the languages used: rust or cpp. I know far better the latter one, but the former one is surely much more pleasant to work with. It depends on how much time I can dedicate to learn rust properly. And networking as well.
