# 'a top down approach'

Bookmark (ch.section(.subsection)): 5


in a distant future: learn to manage sockets with rust (chapter 20 of the-book)

## various practice ideas for the book:

### quiz:
- book summaries
- online quizzes  (interactive quiz from the website of Kurose is the FASTEST to verify your knowledge)

### Problems:
You cannot make them all. I advise to do the ones which seems more interesting and practical. A top target would be half of those.

### dirty-hands exercises:
- programming assignment 3 of chapter 2 (send an email by a local mail server!)
- wireshark lab on dns at the end of the chapter

# external exercises
- basic exercises that chatgpt suggests to learn networking with libraries cpp and c.
- networking experiments with rpi (eventually follow the appropriate book)
- the ones from karan-goel repo
