I must write a conditional http-request
I choose https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_calculus

I first connect with

telnet nameofthewebsite 80

and then I write:

GET /wiki/Stochastic_calculus HTTP/1.1
Host: en.wikipedia.org
If-modified-since: Mon, 6 Nov 2023 09:23:24
Connection: close
User-agent: Mozilla/5.0

I continously receive the message 301 moved permanently, and I suspect that this is related to the usage of https and not http

I was right, the answer is here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74646764/always-301-moved-permanently

I try like this

telnet example.com 80

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
